# AI Usage

## AI assistance
I used AI as a productivity tool to iterate faster on architecture and implementation details (e.g., project structure, error contracts, migration workflows, and test strategy). All suggestions were reviewed, adapted, and validated by me, and I made the final decisions for the design and code changes.

Context Files feature was used to provide the AI with relevant project files for better suggestions. You can find them in the root folder under `CONTEXT_BASE.md` and `TASK_CONTEXT.md`.

CONTEXT_BASE.md includes general project guidelines like coding style, architecture principles, and best practices to follow. We set things like "Use Clean Architecture principles", "Prefer composition over inheritance", "Write idiomatic Go code", etc.

TASK_CONTEXT.md includes specific files related to the current task or feature being worked on. For example, if working on payment processing, it might include relevant domain models, use cases, and API definitions.

I took into consideration the AI's suggestions, but ultimately made all design and implementation decisions myself. 
Also, I ensured that the final code adheres to project standards and best practices.

Interesting to mention that i had to make sure the AI didn't make any commits or changes without my review, so I always double checked everything before accepting any suggestion.

🤖We should use the AI to learn and improve our skills, not to replace our judgement.
